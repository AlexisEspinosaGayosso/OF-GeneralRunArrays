MESSAGE: Equalizing scripts
I'm trying to make the bash scripts to run also in behemoth in order to perform some postprocessing
there.
I now use the environment variable $MYSCRATCH and my own created $MYBASE_AEG, which together with
$MYGROUP should help to equalize things as I wil define all these variables in behemoth too.

Final touches needed to make things work in Behemoth. I defined a script variable for the
name of python.
